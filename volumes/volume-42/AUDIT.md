# தொகுதி 42 — source intake audit

**Intake date:** 2026-09-19  
**Controlling attachment:** `TVA_BOK_0065826_கலைஞரின்_கடிதங்கள்_தொகுதி_42.pdf`

This is a **source-intake audit only**. It is not the later full-volume Tamil structural audit and does not imply textual-fidelity completion.

## 1. Source identity

| Check | Intake result |
|---|---|
| Volume printed on scan | **42** |
| Visible date span | **31.01.2009–30.10.2009** |
| Publisher | **Seethai Pathippagam** |
| Edition | **1st edition, 2022** |
| Printed page statement | **400 pages** |
| Controlling PDF pages | **402 physical PDF pages** |
| Current attachment bytes | **232,174,916** |
| Usable parsed/searchable text layer | **none available; scan controls** |

## 2. Source extent finding

**COMPLETE 402-PAGE SOURCE AVAILABLE.**

The earlier inspection path surfaced only the first **150 rendered preview pages**. The user corrected that interpretation: the actual controlling PDF contains **402 physical pages**. The repository therefore treats 402 as the source extent.

Consequences:

- no source-gap claim is created from the preview-layer limit;
- full-volume transcription can proceed through PDF 402;
- full-volume structural audit remains a later gate after canonical page coverage is complete.

## 3. Printed contents intake

- Printed contents: PDF **018–022**.
- Provisional row count: **64**.
- Nominal number span: **3364–3427**.
- Visible numbering anomaly: contents print **3154** between **3376** and **3378**.

The anomaly is preserved as printed. Its archival interpretation remains pending direct verification of the actual letter-start page.

## 4. First-batch boundary

- First source letter: **3364**.
- Start: **PDF 024 / printed page 23**.
- PDF **025** remains inside Letter 3364.

Therefore the mandatory first transcription commit must stop at PDF 25 and leave Letter 3364 **partial**. The next commit begins at PDF 26 and finishes that same letter.

## 5. Intake result

**PASS — Volume 42 intake structure established.**

The complete 402-page source is available.

## 6. Series front matter handling

PDF **001–017** will be processed under `SERIES_FRONT_MATTER_POLICY.md` rather than blindly re-transcribed.

This does **not** mean those pages are skipped. Each physical page must still receive a repository page record and a direct visual comparison. Matching recurring pages may reference the shared canonical front matter; PDF 001–003 volume-specific fields and any printed-text deviations must be recorded locally.


## 7. Batch 001 — PDF 001–025

**Commit scope:** mandatory first transcription batch.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Canonical page records | **25 / 25 — page-001.md through page-025.md** |
| PDF 001–003 | Volume-specific metadata captured locally |
| PDF 004–017 | **shared-series-front-matter-verified** against Volume 43 reference |
| PDF 018–022 | printed contents fully transcribed |
| PDF 023 | blank/show-through page recorded |
| PDF 024–025 | Letter 3364 partial transcription |
| Contents row count | **64 / 64** |
| Contents anomaly | **3154 preserved between 3376 and 3378** |
| Completed letters | **0** |
| Partial letters | **3364** |
| Invalid replacement Unicode | none intentionally introduced |
| English work | blocked |

### Shared-front-matter verification

Direct target-scan review of PDF 004–017 found no printed-text variance requiring a local full transcription. The target pages therefore use reference-only records pointing to the verified Volume 43 canonical front matter. PDF 001–003 retain Volume 42-specific local fields.

### First letter boundary

Letter **3364 — உழைத்திடும் பிறவியும், ஓய்வெடுக்கும் உல்லாசியும்!** begins at PDF **024 / printed 23**. PDF 025 ends mid-answer, so the record remains **partial** and must continue at PDF 026.

**Batch 001 result: PASS.** This is an iteration audit only; it does not claim full-volume structural or second visual verification.
