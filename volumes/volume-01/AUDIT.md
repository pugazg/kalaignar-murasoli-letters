## Migration rule

The existing `volumes/volume-1/` corpus is preserved as legacy provenance. The scan controls the new canonical page layer. Existing source-corrected Tamil and English may assist comparison but cannot silently override the printed scan.

## Iteration 1 — mandatory PDF 001–025

**Result: PASS — first-pass canonical migration complete for this scope.**

Coverage:

- PDF 001: front cover
- PDF 002: title page
- PDF 003: publication/distribution matter
- PDF 004: illustrated dedication/front matter
- PDF 005: blank page with faint show-through only
- PDF 006–014: M. K. Stalin foreword/panindurai, printed pages 5–13
- PDF 015–017: publisher preface, printed pages 14–16
- PDF 018–023: printed contents, printed pages 17–22, **110 entries**
- PDF 024–025: start of letter 0001, printed pages 23–24

Checks performed:

- one canonical Markdown page per PDF page in scope: **25 / 25**;
- page numbering and printed-page offset checked against the scan;
- front matter distinguished from library stamps/handwriting;
- printed contents preserved as printed rather than replaced by legacy actual-letter titles;
- contents entry 63 preserves its blank printed date cell;
- letter 0001 title/date/start checked against the scan;
- page-25 boundary intentionally left partial; no text from PDF 026 was imported;
- no source PDF was committed;
- no legacy bilingual file was changed;
- no English migration/translation was started.

## Boundary

Letter **0001 — `“ஜாக்குலின்கள்”`** begins at PDF 024 / printed 23 and remains partial after PDF 025. The next canonical commit must start at PDF 026 and finish only this interrupted letter through its visually verified end.

This iteration is a first-pass visual transcription gate. It is **not** the later full-volume structural audit, second visual verification, or translation textual-fidelity audit.
